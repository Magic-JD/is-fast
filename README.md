# Configuration Guide

This project supports both built-in and user-provided configurations for styles and content selection rules.
Configuration is handled using a TOML file, and a default configuration is embedded within the binary. Users can
override this configuration by placing a custom config file in their system's configuration directory. Changes will only
take effect once the program is run again.

## Default Configuration

A built-in configuration is included with the binary and is loaded automatically. The default configuration defines
styles for various elements and selectors for extracting content from different websites.

Users can override the default configuration by creating a TOML configuration file in their system‚Äôs configuration
directory.

### `--generate-config`

Creates a `config.toml` in your system's configuration directory for customization:

```sh
is-fast --generate-config
```

This will only run if the user does not already have a configuration file in that location.

### Location of User Configuration File

If not generated the configuration file should be placed in:

- **Linux**: `~/.config/is-fast/config.toml`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/is-fast/config.toml`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\is-fast\config.toml`

If the `--generate-config` command is used a copy of the default configuration will be placed there automatically.

If you don't want to use the default config location, setting the environment variable `IS_FAST_CONFIG_PATH` will enable you to
place it whereever you like.

```sh
export IS_FAST_CONFIG_PATH="/full/path/to/config.toml"
```

## üè∑ Block Elements

### Definition

Block elements are HTML tags that should have **a new line before and after** them when processed. This helps preserve
readability and logical structure in the parsed content.

### Example Configuration

```toml
block_elements = [
    "p", "div", "article", "section", "pre", "blockquote", "ul", "ol", "dl", "dt", "dd", "li",
    "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6"
]
```

### Effect on Output

#### Input HTML:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p><h2>Title</h2><ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>
```

#### Output After Processing:

```
This is a paragraph.

Title

- Item 1
- Item 2
```

Each **block element** is **separated by a new line** for better readability.

## üö´ Ignored Tags

### Definition

Ignored tags are HTML elements that **will be completely removed** from the processed content. These typically include *
*scripts, metadata, and interactive elements** that are irrelevant to text processing.

### Example Configuration

```toml
ignored_tags = [
    "script", "style", "noscript", "head", "title", "meta", "input", "button", "svg", "nav",
    "footer", "header", "aside"
]
```

### Effect on Output

#### Input HTML:

```html
<head><title>My Page</title></head>
<body>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
  <script>alert("Hello");</script>
  <footer>¬© 2025 My Website</footer>
</body>
```

#### Output After Processing:

```
Hello, world!
```

- **`<script>` and `<footer>` are removed**.
- **Only meaningful content remains**.

## üîç Selectors

### Definition

Selectors allow you to **extract only relevant content** from different websites. This is useful for customizing certain
sites for a better user experience. If no selector is provided for a specific site then `body` will be used. Glob
matching is used to match the site, or even certain urls within the site to extract the most relevant text. NOTE: If
there are multiple globs that could match, the most restrictive should be placed higher in the config! Selectors are
chosen from the first match only.

### Example Configuration

```toml
[selectors]
"*en.wikipedia.org*" = "p"
"*github.com/*/blob/*" = ".react-code-line-contents" # Selectors will apply in this order
"*github.com*" = ".markdown-body"
```

### Effect

When processing content from Wikipedia, only `<p>` elements will be extracted. For github, if the url contains the
endpoint blob it will return only elements with the CSS class .react-code-line-contents. Otherwise it will return the
.markdown-body.

## üé® Text Styles

### Definition

This section defines **how different HTML tags should be styled** in the output. Colors can be specified using standard color names (e.g., red, blue),
hex values (e.g., #ff5733), or RGB notation (e.g., rgb(255, 87, 51)).

### Example Configuration

```toml
[styles.h1]
bold = true

[styles.a]
fg = "Cyan"

[styles.blockquote]
fg = "Gray"
italic = true
```

This means:

- `<h1>` will be **bold**.
- `<a>` (links) will be **cyan**.
- `<blockquote>` will be **gray** and **italicised**.

## üåà Syntax Highlighting

The `[syntax]` section defines syntax highlighting settings for code. Where possible the language type will be
determined from the CSS classes present in the HTML.

### Default Language

This defines the language that is used if the language type cannot be determined from the CSS classes. This should be
set to your primary development language.

### Theme

This sets the theme that should be used. Valid themes are:

```
InspiredGitHub
Solarized (dark)
Solarized (light)
base16-eighties.dark
base16-mocha.dark
base16-ocean.dark
base16-ocean.light
```

### Example:

```toml
[syntax]
default_language = "rust"
theme = "base16-ocean.dark"
```


## üé® Display Settings

The `[display]` section defines visual aspects of the output.

### Border Color

This sets the border color used in the UI.

### Page Margin

A percentage of the page width that should be empty on either side.

### Scroll Amount

The amount that page down/page up should scroll you. Default to full page. Valid values are `full`, `half` and a numerical value, which will scroll that number of lines.

### Color Mode

This sets when color should be shown. The default behavior is for it to show in the TUI but not in the `--piped` or redirected output. Possible values are `tui` `never` and `always`. This can be overriden by applying the `--color` flag when running `is-fast`

### Example:

```toml
[display]
border_color = "#74c7ec"
page_margin = 10
scroll = "10"
color_mode = "always"
```

## üï∞Ô∏è History Settings

The `[history]` section defines how historical entries should be displayed.

### Title Color

Sets the color for titles in the history list.

### URL Color

Defines the color for URLs in the history list.

### Time Color

Sets the color for the time field in the history list.

### Text Color

Defines the text color of the search bar for history entries.

### Search Type

Determines the type of search used for history entries. Available options:
- `fuzzy` (default) - Uses a fuzzy search algorithm.
- `substring` - Matches substrings exactly.
- `exact` - Requires an exact match.

### Enabled

Set this to `false` to stop tracking the sites you have visited.

### Example:

```toml
[history]
title_color = "rgb(137, 180, 250)"
url_color = "rgb(186, 194, 222)"
time_color = "rgb(242, 205, 205)"
text_color = "rgb(116, 199, 236)"
search_type = "fuzzy"
enabled = false # Not currently tracking your history.
```

## üîç Search Configuration

### Engine

Determines which search engine is used when performing searches. Available options:

- `duckduckgo` (default) - Uses DuckDuckGo for search queries.
- `google` - Uses Google Custom Search. **Requires API configuration** (see below).
- `kagi` - Uses Kagi Search. **Requires API configuration** (see below).

### üìå API Configuration for Google Search

If you choose `google` as your search engine, you must set up a Google Custom Search API. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Google Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview) page.
2. Click **Get Started** and enable the API in your Google Cloud Console.
3. Generate an **API Key** from the credentials section.
4. Create a **Custom Search Engine** and obtain the **Search Engine ID**.
5. Set the following environment variables:

```sh
export IS_FAST_GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export IS_FAST_GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="your_search_engine_id_here"
```

These values must be provided for Google Search to function properly.

### üìå API Configuration for Kagi Search

If you choose `kagi` as your search engine, you must have access to the Kagi search API. Relevant documentation is [here](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/search.html).

After obtaining access and your API key, set the following environment variable:
```sh
export IS_FAST_KAGI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### Custom search engine

If you want to add your own custom search engine, please fork the repository and follow the instructions on [this file](src/search_engine/search_type.rs).


### Example Configuration

```toml
[search]
engine = "google"
```

### Site

If you want to restrict your search only to a certain domain, setting this value will only show you search results from
that domain. This can be overridden by the `--site` argument.

### Example Configuration

```toml
[search]
site = "en.wikipedia.org"
```

## ‚ùì Miscellaneous Settings

### Open tool

This setting is unset by default, and controls the program that is used to open the page if you choose to open in browser. If unset this will be your default open tool. If you set this value it will execute the tool given to it. The tool must be available in your system to be able to run.

### Example Configuration

```toml
[misc]
open_tool = "w3m"
```

# üåê Using `is-fast` to Open URLs Directly

`is-fast` allows you to open a specific URL directly in its terminal viewer, bypassing the search functionality. This is
done using the `--direct` option.

### `--direct` / `-d`

**Open a given URL directly in the TUI viewer.**

If this option is provided, `is-fast` will immediately load and render the contents of the given URL inside the terminal
interface.

#### Example Usage:

```sh
is-fast --direct "https://example.com"
is-fast -d https://example.com
```

---

# üìÉ Using `is-fast` with Local HTML Files

`is-fast` also supports rendering local HTML files inside its terminal viewer. This is done using the `--file` option.
Additionally, you can associate the file with a reference URL using the `--url` option.

### `--file` / `-f`

**View a local HTML file instead of performing an internet search.**

If this option is provided, `is-fast` will render the given HTML file inside its terminal viewer instead of fetching
search results from the internet.

#### Example Usage:

```sh
is-fast --file example.html
is-fast -f example.html
```

### `--url` / `-u`

**Associate the HTML file with a reference URL.**

This option is only valid when `--file` is used. It allows you to provide a URL that will be used for informing which
selector should be used with this file.

#### Example Usage:

```sh
is-fast --file example.html --url example.com
is-fast -f example.html -u example.com
```

---

# üîÑ Using `--piped`, `|` or `>` to Output to Standard Output

Instead of rendering the content inside the TUI viewer, `is-fast` provides an option to output the processed result
directly to **standard output (stdout)**. This allows you to **pipe the output** to other commands or **write it to a
file**. This can be directly invoked using the `--piped` command in the case that you just want to print to stdout, or 
added implicitly in the case that the output is not the terminal. The result is in plain text unless `--color=always` 
is applied, but otherwise with the formatting you would see in the TUI.

## Output type

### Search command

When used with a regular search, the first search result will be sent out.

### `--direct` or `--file`

The contents of the page will be output.

### `--history`

The history database will be output in CSV format. If you want to further manipulate/query this data, I recommend 
[mlr](https://github.com/johnkerl/miller) for processing it. If you are more comfortable with json processing, using `mlr`
you can easily convert to json to be processed by [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq).

Here is how you could get a list of all the titles this way.

```sh
is-fast --history | mlr --icsv --ojson cat | jq '.[].title'
```

#### Example Usage:

```sh
# Output the contents of a local file to stdout
is-fast --file example.html --piped

# Fetch and output the contents of a URL to stdout
is-fast --direct "https://example.com" --piped

# Save the output to a file
is-fast --file example.html > output.txt

# Pipe the output into another command
is-fast --direct "https://example.com" | grep "keyword"
```

Using `--piped` makes `is-fast` behave more like a **command-line utility** for extracting and processing content,
rather than an interactive TUI viewer.

---

# üìú Viewing History in `is-fast`

`is-fast` allows you to view and select previously visited pages using the `--history` option.

### `--history`

**Show previously viewed pages.**

If this option is provided, `is-fast` will display a list of previously visited webpages, numbered with the most recent
entries at the bottom. You can scroll up and down and select to open. The entries are stored locally in a SQLite
database. If you don't wish for your sites to be tracked, then you can switch this feature off in the Configuration. 
The argument will still show your current history, but new searches will not add to your history. You can delete 
from your history by using the delete key in the history view.

#### Example Usage:

```sh
is-fast --history
```

---

# üîë Customizing your results

### `--selector/-s`

Apply the given CSS selector to the page. This will only apply to --file and --direct queries.

```sh
is-fast --selector ".interesting" --direct "www.site.com"
```

### `--nth-element`

Normally used in conjunction with `--selector` this allows you to only return the nth element that matches that selector.

```sh
    is-fast --direct "www.example.com/site" --selector "div.sb" --nth-element 1 --nth-element 3 # There are multiple div.sb elements - we only want to see the first and third
```

### `--site`

This will restrict the search to only the given domain.

```sh
is-fast --site "en.wikipedia.org" "Rust programming language"
```

### `--color`

This allows the caller to specify the color mode. Default value is `tui`, which will only show color in the TUI mode. However it can also be set to `never` and `always`

```sh
is-fast --color=always "How to do a for loop in rust" | bat # Will output to bat with full colors
```

### `--last`

This will show the last page from your history. History must be enabled and have entries for this flag to work. This is very useful for scripts where a search is involved, as search resuts are non deterministic, so repeating with the same search might lead you to have *different results*.

```sh
isf_so() {
    QUESTION=$(is-fast ${*} --site "www.stackoverflow.com" --selector "div.question .js-post-body" --color=always --piped) # Find the question content.
    ANSWER=$(is-fast --last --selector "div.accepted-answer .js-post-body" --color=always --piped) # Separately find the answer content, using last to ensure the same result is shown.
    cat << EOF # Format as desired
QUESTION:

$QUESTION

ANSWER:

$ANSWER
EOF
}
```

# Example scripts

Please see the [scripts](scripts) folder for some fun little functions that show how `is-fast` can be be used in a powerful and flexible way as a cli utility for retrieving information from the web.
