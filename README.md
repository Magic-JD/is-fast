# Configuration Guide

This project supports both built-in and user-provided configurations for styles and content selection rules. Configuration is handled using a TOML file, and a default configuration is embedded within the binary. Users can override this configuration by placing a custom config file in their system's configuration directory.

## Default Configuration

A built-in configuration is included with the binary and is loaded automatically. The default configuration defines styles for various elements and selectors for extracting content from different websites.

### Full Default Configuration

```toml
[styles.h1]
bold = true

[styles.h2]
bold = true

[styles.h3]
bold = true

[styles.a]
fg = "Cyan"

[styles.code]
fg = "Red"

[styles.em]
italic = true

[styles.i]
italic = true

[styles.strong]
bold = true

[styles.b]
bold = true

[styles.blockquote]
fg = "Gray"
italic = true

[styles.del]
crossed_out = true

[styles.ins]
underlined = true

[styles.mark]
fg = "Black"
bg = "Yellow"

[styles.small]
fg = "Gray"

[styles.sub]
fg = "Gray"
dim = true

[styles.sup]
fg = "Gray"
dim = true

[styles.pre]
fg = "White"
bg = "Black"

[styles.kbd]
fg = "White"
bg = "DarkGray"

[styles.var]
fg = "Cyan"

[styles.samp]
fg = "Magenta"

[styles.u]
underlined = true

[styles.li]
bold = true

[styles.dt]
bold = true

[styles.dd]
fg = "Gray"

[selectors]
"en.wikipedia.org" = "p"
"www.baeldung.com" = ".post-content"
"www.w3schools.com" = "#main"
"linuxhandbook.com" = "article"
"docs.spring.io" = "article"
"stackoverflow.com" = ".js-post-body, .user-details, .comment-body"
"github.com" = ".markdown-body"
```

## User Configuration

Users can override the default configuration by creating a TOML configuration file in their system’s configuration directory.

### Location of User Configuration File

The configuration file should be placed in:

- **Linux**: `~/.config/is-fast/config.toml`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/is-fast/config.toml`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\is-fast\config.toml`

### Example User Configuration File

```toml
[styles.h1]
fg = "Blue"
bold = true

[styles.code]
fg = "Green"

[selectors]
"example.com" = "article"
"website.gov" = ".main-section"
```

## Configuration Loading Behavior

1. The program first loads the built-in configuration.
2. If a user configuration file exists, it is loaded and overrides the corresponding values from the default configuration.
3. Any missing values in the user configuration will fall back to the default values.

## Selecting Elements from Websites

The application extracts content from different websites based on the `selectors` mapping. When processing a URL, it checks against the keys in the `selectors` table and applies the corresponding CSS selector to extract relevant content.

### Example Usage

When processing a wikipedia page, the program looks up `en.wikipedia.org` in the `selectors` table and applies the selector `p` to extract the article content.

If no matching selector is found, it defaults to extracting content from the `<body>` tag.

## Modifying the Configuration

To customize styles or add new site selectors, edit your user configuration file and restart the application for changes to take effect.

If you need to reset to the default configuration, delete the user configuration file and restart the application.
